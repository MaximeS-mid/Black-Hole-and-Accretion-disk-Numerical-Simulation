## ðŸ“– Overview

This project simulates the observation of a Schwarzschild black hole and its accretion disk using numerical methods and general relativity. The simulation includes:
- Photon trajectory deviation due to gravitational lensing.
- Raytracing to generate realistic images of the black hole and disk.
- Temperature distribution modeling (black body radiation, affine and $r^{-3/4}$ laws).
- Relativistic Doppler and gravitational redshift effects.

The goal is to reproduce the visual appearance of a black hole as predicted by general relativity, and to study the physical phenomena involved.

This repository contains two reports, the original in French used for the examination and an English translation produced by Mistral AI.
